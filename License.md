In addition, the collaborators request that the following conditions be met (although they're not required, doing so let's you be known as
a nice person)

1. Before modifying the code, we encourage you to contact us. Your modifications may actually be included in the base program!
2. We encourage you to use links to the GitHub repo or any installers for the programs (e.g. TACEATS) instead of distributing the code
directly. This helps to ensure that everyone is on the right version.
3. Before using the code for-profit, please contact MajGenRelativity or Gavle on irc.esper.net or Discord (we have bets going to see how
long it will take before someone uses our code for profit).

If you have any questions or want/need to negotiate a less restrictive license, please contact MajGenRelativity or Gavle on irc.esper.net
or Discord.

We thank you for your cooperation.
