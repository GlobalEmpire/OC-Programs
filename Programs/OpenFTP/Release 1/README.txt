#OpenFTP Instructions#
######################

Thank you for choosing OpenFTP: Coded by Tonatsi (Also known as Leothehero)

To use the program (Release 1); you will need 1 server and 1 client.
There are two types available, one that utilises the GERT Networking Protocol; and one that utilises network cards in OpenComputers.

--Although this program will work with any Lua compatible operating system that utilises the same modem component access as the default OpenOS, it is recommended to use a secure Operating system; at minimum for the file-server, such as the FUCHAS OS. It is uncertain exactly how secure this program can be as it was not designed with FUCHAS or other OS in mind, and may not adhere to their security guidelines or make use of its features.

#With GERT#

You can have more than one server host with GERT as there is no automatic discovery: you must obtain the address of the server yourself.
You can type "ADDRESS" while the server program is running (it is capable of running in the background) and "Hide" to enter background mode; to free up the computer for other uses.

>>>However it can not respond to commands in background mode, and it must not be run a second time as there is not yet any process duplication detection. Reboot before re-running; or terminate the processes yourself.
>>>Please report any errors and bugs to Tonatsi; and tell me exactly how to replicate it.

To install; simple place the code in a file somewhere; and execute it. If you intend to have a computer that is solely for this program; you can leave it on the desktop.
A standalone computer is advised; since the server dumps all incoming files in /home/ and does not have any way of deleting files other than someone using the RM command themselves.
It is recommended to autorun the file so that you do not have to worry about whether the program has already been executed or not.
Make sure that GERTi is properly setup on the network; refer to the GERTi wiki for further information.

Once the server is running and you know the address; you can install the Client application on any computer you wish that is also connected to the GERTi Network. Does not work using GERTe... yet!
Then run the program; and follow the onscreen prompts. To exit the program; press ctrl+alt+c. More functions will be added in future versions; this version is effectively a prototype/proof of concept.

#Without GERT#
##############

Simply follow the same instructions as above; just without the GERTi stuff.

>>>You cannot have more than one server on any connected network (unless you filter out discovery broadcasts from clients to separate between the outside of the network and the inside).

Both Types have the same functionality; although the one that does not use GERTi might run a bit faster; and supports automatic discovery.
