OpenChat is a Chat room where multiple clients can connect to one OpenChat server and speak to one another throughout minecraft. OpenChat features a nice GUI with a simple aesthetic. The server is simple but allows easy modifications, with a simple log of all messages and their times.

Future development

In the future I tend to add command support a long with an API so that external lua files, or addons can be added to the server to implement custom commands and features.



Installation

1) You will need a configured GERTi network running. The computers running server.lua and client.lua must have 
GERTiClient.lua running.

2) Install these libraries :
pastebin run ryhyXUKZ

(GUI, advancedLua, color, doubleBuffering, image and OCIF)
3) Install server.lua on one computer and run it.
4) Install client.lua on at least two computers, and run it after running server.lua
