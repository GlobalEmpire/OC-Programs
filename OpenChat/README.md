##About
OpenChat is a Chat room where multiple clients can connect to one OpenChat server and speak to one another throughout minecraft. OpenChat features a nice GUI with a simple aesthetic. The server is simple but allows easy modifications, with a simple log of all messages and their times.

###Future development
In the future I tend to add command support a long with an API so that external lua files, or addons can be added to the server to implement custom commands and features.


###Installation
To install this, you will need a GERTiMNC Server, GERTiClient.lua in /lib

and to install these libraries :

pastebin run ryhyXUKZ

(GUI, advancedLua, color, doubleBuffering, image and OCIF)
